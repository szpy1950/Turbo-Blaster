## Premise

In *Turbo-Blaster*, you drive a fast futuristic car through endless traffic on a dangerous highway. But this time, you're not just dodging cars — you can shoot! Blast your way forward by destroying obstacles in your path. The road never ends, and the game gets harder the longer you survive. 

**Your goal:** reach the highest score by driving far, dodging, and shooting everything that gets in your way.

## Gameplay

This game is made for PC and only needs a keyboard to play. The car moves forward by itself. Your job is to:

- Steer left and right  
- Avoid enemy cars  
- Shoot forward to destroy obstacles  

As the game goes on, your speed increases. The more distance you cover, the higher your score. If you crash into something, the game ends. Try again and beat your high score!
